# C-Kinematics
C-Kinematics is useful for any students in a basic physical science class. It's primary function, while originally for just leaning C, turned to a short labor-of-love for all students struggling with basic physics, not be condescending, but instead to help see the relationship between variables, and to calculate the variables to help just get the answer out of the way.

This program is NOT designed for academic dishonesty in any way, shape, or form! Any cases of such are not my fault, and should be dealt with by school or university faculty to any student(s) that use this program for such actions.
